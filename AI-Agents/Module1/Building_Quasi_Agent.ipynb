    "# Building a Quasi-Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "A quasi-agent is like a lightweight version of an AI agent. It acts as a smart assistant that can follow instructions step by step,\n",
    "\n",
    "but it can’t make decisions or learn from feedback like a full-fledged agent would.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we’re building one that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Asks the user to provide a customer complaint (like a chatbot)\n",
    "- Generates a professional and empathetic initial response\n",
    "- Enhances the tone and adds personalization to the message\n",
    "- Appends a compensation or resolution plan to retain customer trust\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a controlled simulation of an AI assistant with memory, \n",
    "\n",
    "built to practice how to maintain context across steps and manage multi-turn interactions using prompt chaining."
