    "For example, imagine the Agent is helping you book a flight. \n",
    "If it tries to book the ticket but fails because it used the wrong airport code, it should remember the error \n",

    "it needs to remember each step's result so it can keep going without starting over."

      "Sure! In functional programming, immutability is a key concept, so when performing operations like swapping keys and values in a dictionary, we can make use of immutable data structures and functions that return new data structures instead of modifying the existing ones. Since Python is multi-paradigm and supports both functional programming and other styles, we can achieve this by using functions like `map` and dictionary comprehensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hereâ€™s how you can write a function to swap the keys and values in a dictionary:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def swap_keys_values(d):\n",
      "    return {value: key for key, value in d.items()}\n",
      "\n",
      "# Example usage:\n",
      "original_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n",
      "swapped_dict = swap_keys_values(original_dict)\n",
      "print(swapped_dict)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Explanation\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Dictionary Comprehension**: We use dictionary comprehension with `for key, value in d.items()`, which iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary `d`.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Swapping**: For each key-value pair, the new dictionary `{value: key}` swaps the roles of key and value.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Immutability**: Note that this operation results in a new dictionary being created, leaving the original dictionary `d` unchanged.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Note\n",
      "\n",
      "- This function assumes all values in the dictionary are unique. If there are duplicate values in the original dictionary, they will override each other in the new dictionary since dictionary keys must be unique. You might want to handle such cases depending on your specific requirements.\n"
