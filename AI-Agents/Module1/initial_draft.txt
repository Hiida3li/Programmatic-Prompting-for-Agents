Subject: Task Handover for Collaboration and Review

Hi John,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request that you hand over the current task to me so I can add my contributions to it. Once I have incorporated my part, I will send it to Alice for her review. After she has reviewed it, it will be referred back to me for any final adjustments.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if there are specific files or details I need to be aware of. I appreciate your cooperation and look forward to collaborating effectively.

Thank you.

Best regards,
