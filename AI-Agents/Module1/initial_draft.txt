Hi Ahmed,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss our ongoing projects and next steps. Would you be available for a meeting sometime this week? Please let me know your available times, and I will do my best to accommodate.

Looking forward to our discussion.
