Subject: Request for Time Off Due to Family Emergency

Dear John,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I am facing a family emergency that requires my immediate attention. I kindly request to take time off from work next week to handle these pressing matters.

I understand the timing may not be ideal and will ensure that any urgent tasks are delegated to colleagues or managed appropriately before my absence. I will stay in contact as much as possible to minimize any disruption.

Please let me know if there are any forms or procedures I need to complete to formalize this request. Your understanding and support during this difficult time would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
