Subject: Request for Task Handover and Coordination

Dear John,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to kindly request that you transfer the current task to me to enable me to incorporate my contributions. Following this, I will forward the updated work to Alice for her review. Upon completion of her review, she will refer it back to me for any necessary final adjustments.

Please let me know if there are specific details or files I should be aware of to ensure a seamless transition and collaboration. Your assistance in this process is greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Warm regards,
