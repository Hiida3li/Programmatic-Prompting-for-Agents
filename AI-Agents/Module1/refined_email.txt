Subject: Request for Time Off Due to Family Emergency

Dear John,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request time off next week due to an unforeseen family emergency that requires my immediate attention. I apologize for the short notice and assure you of my commitment to managing my responsibilities effectively.

In preparation for my absence, I will arrange for any urgent tasks to be covered by colleagues and provide them with the necessary information to ensure continuity. I will also remain available for any essential communications to mitigate any potential disruptions. 

Please let me know if there are any specific procedures or documentation required for this request. Your understanding and support during this challenging time would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
