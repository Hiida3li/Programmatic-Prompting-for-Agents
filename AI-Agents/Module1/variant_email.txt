Subject: Quick Task Transfer and Review Process

Hi John,

I hope you're doing well! I'm writing to ask if you could pass the current task over to me. I want to add my part, and once that's done, I'll send it to Alice for her review. After she checks it out, she'll send it back to me for any final tweaks.

If there's anything specific I should know or any files I need, just let me know. Thanks a bunch for helping out with this!

Take care,

[Your Name]
