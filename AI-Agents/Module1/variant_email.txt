Subject: Formal Request for Emergency Leave

Dear [Manager's Name],

I trust this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request a leave of absence for the duration of next week due to a pressing family emergency that necessitates my presence.

I am fully aware of my duties and responsibilities in my role as Team Leader AI and am committed to minimizing any disruption this may cause. To that end, I am currently making arrangements to complete all outstanding tasks and will work closely with our team to ensure that critical responsibilities are managed in my absence.

I deeply regret any inconvenience this unforeseen situation may cause and would be grateful for your understanding and support. Should you require any additional information or wish to discuss the matter further, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your understanding and support.

Yours sincerely,
Hida
Team Leader AI
